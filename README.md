# 🎧 Spotify Clone (Fun Project)  

Spotify Clone is a fun side project built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
It plays locally stored songs through a custom UI, mimicking some of the basic functionality of Spotify.  
No frameworks or backend are involved — everything is handled on the frontend with pure JavaScript.
